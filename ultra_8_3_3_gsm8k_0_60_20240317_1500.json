        "question": "A tank contains 6000 liters of water, 2000 liters evaporated, and then 3500 liters were drained by Bob. How many liters are in the tank if it now rains for 30 minutes and every 10 minutes 350 liters of rain are added to the tank?",
        "rationale": "find the total amount of water in the tank. First, 2000 liters evaporated from the initial 6000 liters, leaving 6000 - 2000 = 4000 liters. Next, Bob drained 3500 liters, resulting in 4000 - 3500 = 500 liters.  Since it rained for 30 minutes, and 350 liters are added every 10 minutes, a total of 350 x 3 = 1050 liters were added.  Therefore, the tank now contains 500 + 1050 = 1550 liters.",

        "question": "Julia had to make 6 cakes for the party. Each cake takes 12 minutes to mix and needs 9 more minutes to bake than mix. Then it takes 6 more minutes to cool and decorate than to bake. How many hours will it take to make all 6 cakes?",
        "rationale": "calculate the total time. First, we find the baking time by adding 9 minutes to the 12 minutes of mixing, resulting in 12 + 9 = 21 minutes. Then, we add 6 minutes for cooling and decorating, giving us 21 + 6 = 27 minutes. To get the total time for one cake, we add the mixing, baking, and decorating times: 12 + 21 + 27 = 60 minutes. Since 1 hour has 60 minutes, one cake takes 1 hour to make.  Therefore, 6 cakes will take 6 x 1 = 6 hours.",
