      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the total amount of water in the tank. First, 2000 liters evaporated from the initial 6000 liters, leaving 6000 - 2000 = 4000 liters. Next, Bob drained 3500 liters, resulting in 4000 - 3500 = 500 liters. Since it rained for 30 minutes, and 350 liters are added every 10 minutes, a total of 350 x 3 = 1050 liters were added. Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 500 + 1050 = 1550 liters.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of birds seen and then divide by the total number of sites visited. **Step 1: Calculate total birds seen on Monday:** 5 sites x 7 birds/site = 35 birds **Step 2: Calculate total birds seen on Tuesday:** 5 sites x 5 birds/site = 25 birds **Step 3: Calculate total birds seen on Wednesday:** 10 sites x 8 birds/site = 80 birds **Step 4: Calculate total birds seen:** 35 + 25 + 80 = 140 birds **Step 5: Calculate total sites visited:** 5 + 5 + 10 = 20 sites **Step 6: Calculate average birds per site:** 140 birds / 20 sites = 7 birds/site\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the number of trash cans in Veteran's Park after the redistribution. 1. **Calculate half the number of trash cans in Veteran's Park:** 24 / 2 = 12 trash cans. 2. **Add 8 to represent the extra trash cans in Central Park:** 12 + 8 = 20 trash cans. 3. **Divide by 2 to find the number taken from Central Park:** 20 / 2 = 10 trash cans. 4. **Add the 10 trash cans to Veteran's Park:** 24 + 10 = 34 trash cans.\n",

First, we need to find the total number of marbles purchased by the customers by multiplying the number of customers by the number of marbles each bought: 20 customers x 15 marbles/customer = 300 marbles.
